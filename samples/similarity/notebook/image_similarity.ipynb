    "# Image Similarity: AML Package for Computer Vision\n",
    "A large number of problems in the computer vision domain can be solved by ranking images according to their similarity. For example, retail companies want to show customers products which are similar to the ones bought in the past. Or companies with large amounts of data want to organize and search their images effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how the AML Package for Computer vision can be used to train, evaluate, and deploy an image similarity model. Example images and annotations are provided, but the reader can bring their own dataset and train their own unique ranker. Currently, CNTK is used as the deep learning framework. Training is peformed locally on a GPU powered machine ([Deep Learning VM](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.dsvm-deep-learning?tab=Overview)), and deployment uses the Azure ML Operationalization CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is encouraged to first try the **Image Classification** tutorial before running this tutorial as many features from Image Classification are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are performed:\n",
    "1. Dataset Creation\n",
    "2. Image Pairs\n",
    "3. Model Definition and Training\n",
    "4. Evaluation and Visualzation\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "Our approach to measure image similarity is visualized at a high level as shown by the diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/Azure/ImageSimilarityUsingCntk/blob/master/doc/pipeline.jpg?raw=true\" width=800>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given two images, we want to measure the visual distance between them. For the purpose of this tutorial distance and similarity are used interchangebly (since similarity can be computed by simply taking the negative of the distance). \n",
    "* Optionally, in a pre-processing step, one can detect the object-of-interest and crop the image to that area. Please see the Object Detection notebook for how to train and evaluate such a model based on an approach called Faster-RCNN. \n",
    "* Each image is then represented using the output of a DNN which was pre-trained on millions of images. The input to the DNN is simply the image itself, and the output is the penultimate layer (512 floating point values for the ResNet18 model). \n",
    "* These 512-floats image representations are then scaled to each have an L2 norm of one, and the visual distance between two images is defined as a function of their respective 512-floats vectors. Possible distance metrics include the L1 or the L2 norm. The advantage of these metrics is that they are non-parametric and therefore do not require any training. The disadvantage however is that each of the 512 dimensions is assumed to carry the same amount of information which in practice is not true. Hence, we use a Linear SVM to train a weighted L2 distance, which can give a higher weight to informative dimensions, and vice versa down-weight dimensions with little or no information.\n",
    "* Finally, the output of the system is the desired visual similarity for the given image pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the output of a DNN is powerful and is shown to give good results on a wide variety of tasks. However, better results can be achieved through fine-tuning the network before computing the image representations. This approach is known as [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning): starting with an original model trained on a large dataset of generic images, it is then fine-tuned in this tutorial using a small set of images from our own dataset.
