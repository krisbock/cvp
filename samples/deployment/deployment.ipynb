    "Operationalization is the process of publishing models and code as web services and the consumption of these services to produce business results. Once your model is trained, you can deploy your trained model as a webservice for consumption with [Azure Machine Learning CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/cli-for-azure-machine-learning). The API can automatically generate required information and call [Azure Machine Learning Model Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/desktop-workbench/model-management-overview) service to deploy your model. Your model can be deployed to an Azure Container Service (ACS) cluster as a webservice. It also provides some autoscaling functionality for your webservice. Also provided are instructions on how to deploy your model to edge devices to apply computer vision models to data that canâ€™t make it to the cloud due to data sovereignty, privacy, and/or bandwidth issues.\n",
